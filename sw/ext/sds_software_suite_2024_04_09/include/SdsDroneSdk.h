 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 * Sixdof Space has created an optical tracking solution offering precision landing with cm level accuracy both indoors and outdoors in direct sunlight. 
 * Our patented technology leverages infrared lighting to serve as location beacons. Our sensor unit, connected to your drone can see the beacons on the ground at up to 40 meters.
 * Our algorithms will report the 6dof positional data to the drone, to direct an autonomous landing. 
 * 
 * SdsDroneSdk is a shared library that enables users to interface with the Sixdof tracking technology.
 * Drone guidance is the main application of this library, however other applications that require a programmatic interface to the Sixdof technology can use this library as well. 
 *
 * The SdsDroneSdk shared library is available on the following platforms:
 * - Windows 
 * - Linux Ubuntu
 * - Linux Raspberry Pi OS (32 bit)
 * - Linux Raspberry Pi OS (64 bit)
 * 
 * If you want to use the SdsDroneSdk on another platform, please contact the Sixdof team.
 * 
 * @section coordinate_sys_sec Coordinate Systems
 * Before using the Sixdof tracking system it is important to understand the coordinate systems involved. The sensor coordinate system is defined according to the image below:
 * @image html sensor_coordinates.jpg "Sensor coordinate system" width=400px
 * @image latex sensor_coordinates.jpg "Sensor coordinate system" width=150px
 * 
 * Where the positive x-axis points to the right of the sensor, the positive y-axis point out from the sensor and the positive z-axis completes the right handed system. 
 * The field of view can be approximated by a 60 degrees vision cone around the y-axis.
 * 
 * In many applications the user is interested in the location of the drone, and not just the location of the sensor.
 * In these applications, it is the users responsibility to do the rigid body transformation from the sensor to the drone, based on how the sensor is mounted on the drone. 
 * 
 * @section tracking_modes_sec Tracking Modes
 * Three tracking modes are available: 
 * - Sixdof: Track the full 6 degrees of freedom relative to the map. This is intended for applications where the drone is within 6m of the map.
 * - Relative Beacon: Track the position of a beacon relative to the sensor. This is intended to guide a drone to a landing pad with a high powered beacon from 40m down to the final 2m.
 * - Relative Angle: Track the angle of a beacon relative to the sensor. The intent of this mode is similar to Relative Beacon, however it is designed for tracking from very far ranges down to the final descent. 
 * 
 * The SdsDroneSdk provides an easy way to run these two tracking modes, and seamlessly transition between them.
 * 
 * In addition to tracking, a method is provided to enable the user to do gyroscope calibration. 
 * During gyroscope calibration, the sensor must be still. In many applications, it is desirable to initialize the system while already in motion.
 * Therefore, gyroscope calibration can be done in advance to the mission and the calibrated values can be fed in at run time. 
 *
 * @section sixdof_sec Tracking mode Sixdof
 * @image html 6DOF_Light.png "" width=400px
 * @image latex 6DOF_Light.png "" width=250px
 * In this mode, the postion of the sensor is tracked relative to the map. The map is made up of multiple IR beacons that flash unique ids, multiple beacons are driven by a single Basalt board.
 * The user must place these beacons in a rigid formation and provide the X, Y, Z location of each beacon. The unique id of each beacon is provided on each LED individually.
 * The user can define the coordinate system of the map in any way they choose, however it must use a right handed coordinate system.
 * When designing a map, it is important to ensure the lights are not co-linear. Keep in mind the desired area of operation, try to design the map so that there will always be at least 3 beacons in the field of view of the sensor.
 * 
 * @section rel_bec_sec Tracking mode Relative Beacon
 * @image html RelB_Light.png "" width=400px
 * @image latex RelB_Light.png "" width=250px
 * In this mode, the position of a high-powered beacon is tracked relative to the coordinate system of the sensor. 
 * The goal of this mode is to be able to guide a drone from a high elevation (40m) down to a landing pad. This mode does not provide any orientation information.
 * It is important to note that the distance estimate (y-direction) of the beacon is not accurate when far from the beacon. 
 * However, this mode does provide the ability to derive the direction of the beacon in order to align for the descent. 
 * When the beacon is closer (~2m) to the sensor, the distance estimate will be more accurate.
 * The reason for this inaccuracy at large distances is due to the very small baseline on the sensor.
 *  
 * @section rel_angle_sec Tracking mode Relative Angle
 * @image html RelA_Light.png "" width=400px
 * @image latex RelA_Light.png "" width=250px
 * In this mode the angle of a beacon is tracked relative to the coordinate system of the sensor.
 * The goal of this mode is to be able to guide a drone from a high elevation (> 40m) all the way down to a landing pad. This mode does not provide any orientation information of the senor.
 * Additionally, due to the far distance of the beacon the baseline on the sensor is insufficent to calculate the distance directly.
 * In this mode the intensity of the beacon and the peak width in pixels are reported in order to get a rough estimate of the distance of the beacon. 
 * In a configuration where full Sixdof landing is desired, the rough distance estimate is can be used as a signal that the sensor is close enough to transition to Sixdof mode.  
 * 
 * @section tracking_mode_switch Switching between Tracking Modes
 * Switching between tracking modes can be done almost instantly via the setTrackingMode function. 
 * In many drone applications there is a need for the drone to be guided to the landing pad from a high elevation, as well as do a precision landing.
 * In these cases a single high-powered LED can be used along side a map of multiple small LEDs.
 * When the drone is at a high elevation it is guided to the landing target by using "Relative Angles" mode, then when it gets sufficiently close (~6m) it switches to "Sixdof" mode for the final high-precision landing.
 * The combination of "Relative Angles" and "Sixdof" modes is a highly effective way of achieving a targeted landing from a high elevation, however the key component to this solution is the ability to decided when to switch between the tracking modes.
 * In the "Relative Angles" tracking modes the distance to the LED is unknown, however the intensity of the LED and the width in pixel space are provided.
 * From this information a rough estimate of the distance to the landing target can be calculated.
 * Shown below are the results of an experiment where the intensity of the LED was measured at known distances, y-axis is distance in meters and x-axis is the intensity,
 * a polynomial trend line is shown in red:
 * @image html intensity_to_dis.png "" width=400px
 * @image latex intensity_to_dis.png "" width=450px
 * 
 * A rough estimate of the distance between the sensor and the landing target can be obtained from the polynomial fit shown above.
 * Additionally, the width in pixels of the LED can help to enhance the distance estimate when the sensor is close to the light.
 * Note that this relationship is only valid for the beacon that was used in the experiment, in this case a 100 watt beacon, and the intensity to distance relationship can change slightly with lighting conditions.
 * Many drones are equipped with other sensors such as range finders and barometers, these sensors can assist with estimating the distance to the landing target.

 * @section troubleshooting Trouble Shooting Guide
 * @subsection missing_libraries Missing Libraries
 * Make sure to always copy the two shared libraries (.dll on Windows and .so on Linux) that are provided in the release folder for your platform into the the directory with your program. 
 * Alternatively, you can statically link the shared libraries to your program. Also on Windows you have the option of adding the shared libraries to your system PATH. 
 * 
 * @subsection ping_failed Ping Failed
 * Errors relating to ping failing mean that the host computer was unable to connect to the Sixdof sensor.
 * Try the following steps:
 *  -# Ensure the Sixdof sensor is connected to power and the RJ45 ethernet cable is connected to your computer
 *  -# Look at the red indicator lights that are exposed on the top of the senor casing, the lights should be flashing, if the lights are constant please contact the Sixdof team
 *  -# Ensure your NetworkConfig parameters are correct, this is the sensor board number and the network name that the sensor is connected to
 *  -# Your computers ARP table is used to connect to the sensor, try clearing the ARP table and trying again. The ARP table can be cleared vai a command console with administrator privileges, use the command "arp -d" 
 * 
 * @subsection firewall Firewall
 * If SdsDroneSdk is reporting errors related to communication issues, it is recommended to turn off your firewall.
 * 
 * @subsection underprocessing Underprocessing
 * If you are getting the "Warning" status message that says "Not receiving enough buffers from board" that means that your program is not getting enough CPU time. 
 * On Windows systems this is usually due to a spontaneous virus scan, you can temporarily turn off virus scans from in your "Windows Security" settings.

         *    1) Get functions. these will return the most recent data point. However the getStatusMessage function will return all messages in the order they appeared.\n
         *    2) Function callbacks. The callbacks provided will get called each time a new data point is provided.
         * 
         * It is recommended to use function callbacks for status messages to ensure all messages are received immediately. 
         * It is also recommended to register for status messages before initializing the network, this way we can get all messages from the initialization stage.
         * Each function callback is run on its own thread and it only gets updated once it has finished processing its current data point.
         * This means that long running function callbacks may miss data points that got overshadowed by new data, this is by design.
         *
