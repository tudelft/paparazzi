 
- forcast wave 0.5 to 1.0 sec 
- substract wave from ship position so that descent line is not moving by the waves
- plot ship movement in 2d plot
- 

- get a dataset from a real ship with IMU
- kan basis-gps van drone ook worden ingesteld in paparazzi als secondary gps?


- bebop GPS take-over als backup

Notes from phone:
- test Set_offset_here (function did not seem to work in the field)
- mangage logfiles (store them in folders)
- Add Uplink messages also to logfiles
- Improve Matlab analisys somehow to show tracking error more clear
+ Make Matlab autosave figures after analisys
+ Add dotted lines in Matlab to show when approach_moving_target is enabled
- Break harder in guidance_indi when in front of WP (prevent crash into truck/ship cabin)
- Check if bebop speed is completely dependend of guidance_indi, or are there maybe other modules forcing the drone to move?
- Make RTK system in drone robust to loss of RTCM messages
- Filter/smooth signal inside GPS module (watch out for inducing delays)
- Filter ship gps position based on heading/cog (filter roll, but not froward movement)
- Add info to internal logging on drone (logging declared in airframe)
- Analyse what factors cause overshoot of WP in guidance (control params/gps-noise/abrubpt-speedchange)
+ Make every gps-fix save the TOW as timestamp, to make the feedforward accurate with drone and groundstation
? Try to make an all-purpose XML file with IF statements (tried, but without success)
- Create/Plan dataset with gyro/accelerometer at rough sea somehow
- Is there a Derrivative in guidance_indi?
- Only use sonar when drone is sure it is above the deck/truck
- Define better what happens when approach_moving_target_enable() is stoped
- Make sure that guidance_indi/approach does not go des_pos, except when needed

- = TODO
+ = DONE
? = TRIED, but failed

Factors causing overshoot WP:
- gcs no gps-pos update send, but target changed heading/speed
- amt.relvel_gain (approach speed gain) higher than 1.0
- amt.speed_gain (target speed gain) higher than 1.0
- amt.pos_gain (position error gain) too high, so the drone does not slow down early enough
- integration_compensation (if used) because set to 0.0 when passing error=0, but at that point speed is too high
- drone is on WP and ship/truck descellerates (drone always beyond WP in this case)


code to test:
  float ship_rotation = RadOfDeg(target_heading); 
  float offset_centerline_ship = rel_target_pos.x * cosf(ship_rotation) - rel_target_pos.y * sinf(ship_rotation);
  float behind_ship            = rel_target_pos.x * sinf(ship_rotation) + rel_target_pos.y * cosf(ship_rotation);

  printf("ship_rotation: %f \t offset_centerline %f \t behind_ship %f \n", ship_rotation, offset_centerline_ship, behind_ship);
